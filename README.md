The reason for picking 2002 over 1996, is based on the fact that the PSL went from 18 teams to 16 teams in 2002, after **Free State Stars** and **Ria Stars** were bought out by the league for R8 million rand each to reduce fixture congestion. 

# Changes of club name or ownership

A few teams have changed their names or sold their football license to other teams. **AmaZulu** were renamed **Zulu Royals** and later renamed back to **AmaZulu**, **Dynamos** sold their license to **AmaZulu** (formerly **Zulu Royals**), **Tembisa Classic** sold their license to **Maritzburg United** and **Wits University** were renamed **Bidvest Wits**.
