# Premier Soccer League Data
South African soccer results 2002-2017

This is a repository for South African Premier Soccer League (PSL) dataset from 2002 to 2017. The PSL dataset is from 2002 and contains each result of matches played since. The reason for picking 2002 over 1996, is based on the fact that the PSL went from 18 teams to 16 teams in 2002, after **Free State Stars** and **Ria Stars** were bought out by the league for R8 million rand each to reduce fixture congestion. 

# Changes of club name or ownership

A few teams have changed their names or sold their football license to other teams. **AmaZulu** were renamed **Zulu Royals** and later renamed back to **AmaZulu**, **Dynamos** sold their license to **AmaZulu** (formerly **Zulu Royals**), **Tembisa Classic** sold their license to **Maritzburg United** and **Wits University** were renamed **Bidvest Wits**. Finally, **Silver Stars** were renamed **Platinum Stars** and **Benoni Premier United** changed their name to **Thanda Royal Zulu** (this change took place during the 2007 season).
